# Title- STAT-628-Module-2-Body-Fat-Prediction

# Objective- 
Bodyfat percentage is an important measure of the risk of weight-related diseases. Based on a comprehensive dataset that lists estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing and various body circumference measurements for 252 men, we are trying to build a simple model to estimate the bodyfat percentage as accurately as possible.

# Description- 
This is a group project done by Group 18 as part of the curriculum for STAT 628, Fall 2022. We have come up with a simple but efficient model to predict a man's bodyfat based on his weight and abdomen circumference. We have included four folders which contains our R code for the model and Shiny app, plots, data, and presentation and our two page summary.
